# Soulgarden: The Open Source Artifical Soul Companion

## What is this?

Soulgarden is an open-source effort to create an AI companion, or as we like to say Artifial Soul. Soulgarden is different from many other companion systems. To clarify what sets us apart, it might be helpful to take a look at our goals first:

 - [X] Multi-turn chat
 - [X] Complex memory
 - [X] Reasoning and context awareness
 - [ ] Spatial awareness
 - [X] Listening
 - [X] Visual perception (images)
 - [ ] Speaking
 - [ ] Spatial and context-aware selfies
 - [X] Privacy awareness
 - [X] Social Networks
    - [X] Telegram
    - [ ] X (formerly Twitter)

### Multi-turn chat
This is the ability to hold multi-turn conversations, allowing you to write more than one message while Soul responds to all of them as if you were talking to a real person.

### Complex memory
We are designing a memory system that runs locally, enabling Soul to learn and store conversations (and important experiences for Soul).

### Reasoning and context awareness
Before anything else, our Soul goes through a moment of reasoning and reflection, extracting relevant information to plan her next action. She also gathers contextual information that updates parts of her immediate knowledge. The reasoning phase is crucial to determine if she should speak, send an image (feature still in development), or if memory or immediate knowledge is sufficient.

### Spatial awareness
In addition to context awareness, Soul needs to identify where she (and you) are and what she (and you) are doing. For example, if she's going to the kitchen while talking to you, she must be aware of her location in space. This feature governs Soul's incarnation in a 3D space.

### Listening
Soul can listen to voice messages that you send.

### Visual perception (images)
Soul can view and interpret images.

### Speaking
Soul will be able to speak.

### Spatial and context-aware selfies
With spatial awareness, we can continually reproduce Soul wherever she is and whatever she is doing.

### Privacy awareness
Your data never leaves your computer unless you specify otherwise.

### Social Networks
Although weâ€™ve implemented an app for quick chat, ideally Soulgarden should just run on your computer, allowing you the freedom to chat with Soul through your preferred app.

## Installation
Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/SoulGardenAI/Soulgarden/releases) to download the latest version.

### Troubleshooting
If the app gets stuck at 100% downloading or you repeatedly get the message `I can't reply. I'm having technical issues.`, please restart the app. That might resolve the issue.

### Support
We currently support macOS M1 and above (sorry, no x64 yet), and Windows, although Windows has not been thoroughly tested.
